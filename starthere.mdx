# Getting Started

### 

​

Setting up the bot

Open the Inferno bot (@infernotrade_bot) and run `/start` to begin your trading journey. The bot will guide you through the initial setup process and provide you with your personal wallet address.

### 

​

Funding your wallet

After running `/start`, you will be prompted with your wallet address. Deposit Solana (SOL) to your provided address to fund your trading account. You need at least **0.1 SOL** to start trading.

### 

​

Viewing available trades

Use the `/offers` command to see all current trading opportunities. Each offer will show:
- The ticker symbol
- Current price
- Available liquidity
- Potential returns

You can also visit the [web interface](https://infernobot.io/trade) for a complete view of available trades and market data.

### 

​

Opening your first position

Once your wallet is funded, you're ready to trade! To open a long position:

1. Type `/long` followed by the ticker symbol
2. Example: `/long gor`
3. Select your desired leverage when prompted
4. Enter the trade amount:
   - `1` = 1 SOL
   - `0.1` = 0.1 SOL
5. Review the position details including your liquidation price
6. Confirm your order to execute the trade

The bot will notify you once your position is opened successfully.

### 

​

Managing your positions

Now that you have an open position, you can monitor and manage it using these commands:

- `/positions` — view all your current positions and their performance
- `/close` — close any open position and realize your profits or losses
- `/pnl` — check your overall profit and loss
