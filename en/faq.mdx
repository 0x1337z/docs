# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Inferno Trading Bot?
Inferno is an advanced Telegram-based trading bot that allows users to trade tokens with leverage on various meme tokens. It provides a user-friendly interface for both beginners and experienced traders.

3. Fund your wallet and start trading

### Is Inferno safe to use?
Inferno implements industry-standard security measures and has been thoroughly tested. However, all trading involves risk, especially with leverage. Always trade responsibly and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

## Leverage Trading

### What is leverage trading?
Leverage trading allows you to control a larger position size with a smaller amount of capital. For example, with 10x leverage, you can control a $1000 position with only $100 of your own money.

### How does leverage work in Inferno?
When you open a leveraged position in Inferno:
- You specify the amount you want to invest
- You choose your desired leverage multiplier (e.g., 2x, 5x, 10x)
- The bot calculates your position size: Investment Amount × Leverage = Position Size
- Your potential profits and losses are amplified by the leverage multiplier

### What are the risks of leverage trading?
**High Risk Warning**: Leverage trading significantly increases both potential profits and potential losses:
- Small market movements can result in large gains or losses
- You can lose more than your initial investment
- Positions can be liquidated if the market moves against you
- Always use stop-loss orders and risk management strategies

### How do I calculate my potential profit/loss?
```
Profit/Loss = (Exit Price - Entry Price) × Position Size × Leverage
```

**Example**: 
- Investment: $100
- Leverage: 5x
- Position Size: $500
- If price increases 10%: Profit = $500 × 0.10 = $50 (50% return on your $100)

### What happens if my position gets liquidated?
If your position reaches the liquidation threshold:
- Your position will be automatically closed
- You will lose your initial investment
- Any remaining collateral will be returned to your wallet
- The bot will notify you of the liquidation

**Disclaimer**: Trading cryptocurrencies involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. The value of cryptocurrencies can go down as well as up, and you may lose some or all of your investment. Leverage trading increases these risks significantly. Always do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before trading.
